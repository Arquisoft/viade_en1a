=== Quality Scenarios

A table with quality goals and concrete scenarios, ordered by priorities.

* _Quality goal_: Annotate and qualify the functionality.
* _Scenario_: Describe how the system should behave. It specifies quality requirements.
* _Priority_: It has two values: importance for success, and how difficult it is to be achieved.

|Quality goal|Scenario|Priority
|*_Usability_*  | Non-technical people should easily use the application. In case they want to look for information, the content should be found quickly (data taken from real users: 93%) | High, Medium
|*_Confidentiality_*  | The control of user data should be decentralized. This way the user has a complete control of the data they share and receive. | High, High
|*_Interoperability_*  | Our system should be able to exchange data with other systems and present that data so it can be understood by the user. | High, High
|*_Integrity_*  | The application shouldn't have vulnerable points: a third party shouldn't be able to access the data. | High, Medium
|*_Performance efficiency_* | The response and processing times of the application should be quick (avg time: 6 seconds). | High, Medium
|*_Testability_* | The architecture should be designed in such a way that it successfully passes the tests for its implementation (). | High, Medium
|*_Modifiability_* | As Solid is a pioneer evolutive technology, our application should be able to accept changes and be modified. | Medium, Low
|*_Availability_* | Online independence: The user should be able to use the application without need of Internet connection (Not working). | Medium, Medium
|*_Portability_* | The system could work on a mobile device (80%, still working on it). | Low, High
