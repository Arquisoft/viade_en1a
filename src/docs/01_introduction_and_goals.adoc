== Introduction and Goals

The goal of this project is to develop an application which is able to store user routes in a *decentralized* manner but still manages to share these decentralized routes with other users.

The technologies that will be used in the development of this application will be _React_ in the front-end and a _SOLID_ based server in the back-end, as well as _JSON-LD_ for the parsing of routes and _GPX_ for the use of mapping data.

For the foundations of the project we used an open source *generator* for Solid-React applications. 

=== Requirements Overview

These are the *functional* requirements our application will provide:

. Data stored in a decentralized way (separated from the application). Each user has their own pod for the routes to be stored on.

. Users are able to view their routes in a map.

. Users have the possibility to add media elements to their routes.

. Users can share the data stored in their pods with other single users or with groups of users selected by them.

. Users get a notification everytime a route is shared with them.

. Users can use this application in addition to other interoperable ones, as we follow the established conventions of ViadeSpec interoperability proposed by Luis Presa.



=== Quality Goals


* _Quality goal_: Annotate and qualify the functionality.

|Role/Name|Expectations
| *_Teachers of the course_* | The teachers of the course expect the students to deliver a project which is completely functional and fulfills the requirements provided.
| *_Users_* | The people who will use the application expect it to be easy to use, functional and secure.
| *_Inrupt_* | Tim Berners Lee ans his team expect us to provide an application which helps in the decentralization of the web by using _SOLID_ and its principles.
| *_Future Developers_* | Other developers would expect the code to be understandable and easy to maintain.
| *_Other students_* | Next year students would like to understand the code and its functionality, and perhaps reuse some parts of it.
| *_The Team_* | As programmers, we expect to learn new development environments and develop a final product that we can be proud of.
