== Design Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision

|*_Arc42_*  | It provides a template for documentation and communication for the development of the project. Arc 42 eases the process of developing and improving the software architecture.
|*_React_*  | React is the framework chosen to implement the user interfaces. It is based on JavaScript. It also allows the creation of mobile applications by means of Reac Native.
|*_Solid PODs_*  | The routes data will be stored in the users' PODs, allowing users to reserve the right of deciding who can access that data.
|*_GitHub_*  | This is where the project's repository will be located, facilitating us coordinating and taking decissions. Using Git allows us to mantain a different set of branches, with different purposes (e.g., develop, release, master...).
