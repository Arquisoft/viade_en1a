== Design Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision

|Decission|Description|Advantages|Disadvantages
|*_Arc42_*  
    | It provides a template for documentation and communication for the development of the project. Arc 42 eases the process of developing and improving the software architecture. 
    |Commonly used template in Europe for software documentation, which can be converted into and HTML page with relative ease for its release to the internet.
    |Even though it has some guidelines, it's not really restrictive nor hand-holding, meaning that we'll be a bit lost while trying to document our application, as we have no experience with Arc42.
|*_React_*  
    | React is the framework chosen to implement the user interfaces. It is based on JavaScript. It also allows the creation of mobile applications by means of Reac Native.
     | One of the main advantages of using React are its libraries for working with the Solid. 
    |The main drawback for its election is the fact that we have never worked with it, meaning that we have no experience with React.
|*_Solid PODs_*  
    | The routes data will be stored in the users' PODs, allowing users to reserve the right of deciding who can access that data.
    |Since the aim of the project is developing a decentralized application, Solid PODs are a good candidate for data storing. Free, Open Source and gaining popularity, it is an interesting option to use as a base for our application.
    |Again, the lack of experience with this technology can be considered as a drawback. Moreover, Solid  itself is still a project in progress, which will undoubtly lead to problems.
|*_GitHub_*  
    | This is where the project's repository will be located, facilitating us coordinating and taking decissions. Using Git allows us to mantain a different set of branches, with different purposes (e.g., develop, release, master...).
    |Since this a 7 people teamwork, the usage of Git is unquestionable. While there are a bunch of Git hosts, Github is the most used and a feature rich one, meaning that there are no real reasons for using another alternative.
    |The usage of GitHub hardly has any disadvantage, aside from it's learning curve, which is not a huge problem.
|*_Google Maps API_*  
    | We decided to use this API to easily show an interactive world map in our application, and load
    routes in it, so that users can visualize them.
    |It is really easy to integrate in any web app, it also provides a great support for displaying routes using GeoJSON.
    |The only disadvantage we can find is the need to use an API key, for which you will have to pay once you exceed the number of free requests. For the moment, this does not reprensent a problem for our application, since it is not being used massively.
|*_GeoJSON_*  
    | GeoJSON is an open standard, based in JSON, specifically designed for representing geographic elements.
    |Those elements represented with this format can be directly shown in the Google API map, thanks to it Data Layer.
    |It needs to be extended, since we need to add extra information to our rutes, e. g., pictures or a description.
|*_JSON-LD_*  
    | This provides a method for encoding Linked Data in a JSON format.
    |JSON-LD, together with a concrete folder structure, allows us to archieve interoperability with other ViaDe apps in an easy way.
    |This format can not be directly displayed in our map, but it is really easy to parse it into a GeoJSON format.
|*_Molid_*  
    | This package offers an easy way of implementing a complete mock Solid server locally, and simulate HTTP requests to it.
    |Thanks to Molid, a sizable portion of our app can be easily tested without the need of a real POD and Internet conexion.
    |You must create (or copy) and edit the necessary files, with the correct format, to simulate a real and functional POD.
|*_LDflex_*  
    | LDflex allows yo querying Linked Data from the Internet as if you were traversing a local JavaScript graph.
    |With this package we can obtain, with an slight effort, information placed in files referred in the original file we are querying, for example, our friends' names.
    |You are forced to fecth data in an asynchronous way, which leaded us to some problems, such as entering inifinite loops, or rendering views without contents.
