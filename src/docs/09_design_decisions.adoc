== Design Decisions


[role="arc42help"]
****
.Contents
Important, expensive, large scale or risky architecture decisions including rationals.
With "decisions" we mean selecting one alternative based on given criteria.

Please use your judgement to decide whether an architectural decision should be documented
here in this central section or whether you better document it locally
(e.g. within the white box template of one building block).

Avoid redundancy. Refer to section 4, where you already captured the most important decisions of your architecture.

.Motivation
Stakeholders of your system should be able to comprehend and retrace your decisions.

.Form
Various options:

* List or table, ordered by importance and consequences or:
* more detailed in form of separate sections per decision
* ADR (architecture decision record) for every important decision

|Decision|Description|Advantage(s)|Disadvantage(s)
|*_Arc42_* 
    |It provides a template for documentation and communication for the development of the project. Arc 42 eases the process of developing and improving the software architecture.
    |Commonly used template in Europe for software documentation, which can be converted into and HTML page with relative ease for its release to the internet.
    |Even though it has some guidelines, it's not really restrictive nor hand-holding, meaning that we'll be a bit lost while trying to document our application, as we have no experience with Arc42.

|*_React_* 
    |React is the framework chosen to implement the user interfaces. It is based on JavaScript. It also allows the creation of mobile applications by means of React Native. 
    | One of the main advantages of using React are its libraries for working with the Solid. 
    |The main drawback for its election is the fact that we have never worked with it, meaning that we have no experience with React.
|*_Solid PODs_* 
    |The routes data will be stored in the users' PODs, allowing users to reserve the right of deciding who can access that data. 
    |Since the aim of the project is developing a decentralized application, Solid PODs are a good candidate for data storing. Free, Open Source and gaining popularity, it is an interesting option to use as a base for our application.
    |Again, the lack of experience with this technology can be considered as a drawback. Moreover, Solid  itself is still a project in progress, which will undoubtly lead to problems.
|*_GitHub_* 
    |This is where the project's repository will be located, facilitating us coordinating and taking decissions. Using Git allows us to mantain a different set of branches, with different purposes (e.g., develop, release, master...).
    |Since this a 7 people teamwork, the usage of Git is unquestionable. While there are a bunch of Git hosts, Github is the most used and a feature rich one, meaning that there are no real reasons for using another alternative.
    |The usage of GitHub hardly has any disadvantage, aside from it's learning curve, which is not a huge problem.
